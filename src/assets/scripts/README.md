## Portpolio

- My Portfolio project was built towards the beginning of the nology course (weeks 1-4) and then revisted throughout the course to add in different parts of my learning. I did redo the entire design and started in a new github repo when I did that. One option I still have is to rebuild the site as an SPA using React, I havn't yet done this but it's a future option.

- The projects are rendered by Javascript, taking their contents from a projects.js file, but this data could easily be stored in a database and fetched from there.

- I used this project to practice CSS animations, best example of this is the burger menu expansion on mobile sized screens.

## Features to Add

- On Modal for projects, add a next / prev button to aid flicking between one project and the next, removing the need to navigate back to the main page.

- Adjust side padding on smaller screen sizes, so that the section padding around the heading is equal around the entire section, rather that bigger top/bottom, than right/left. Currently 70px, might need to be a bit smaller, maybe 50px?
