        <p>I have recently completed a 12-week intensive software development course at
          <strong><a href="http://www.nology.io" target="_blank">_nology.</a></strong>
          This course was primarily centred on JavaScript and React. It tackled both technical coding
          finesse and practical workplace skills such as testing, pair programming, user stories and backlog creation.
        </p>
        <p>
          I am now seeking opportunites for a <strong>junior software developer</strong> position.</p>
          <p>I'd describe myself as a <strong>full stack developer</strong>, I like being creative with visual design in
            UX/UI, but equally enjoy logic and problem solving.
            I enjoy writing clean, concise and modern code. I build mobile first, intuative and responsive web apps.</p>
            <p>Here's the <strong>tech stack</strong> I've been working with..</p>

              <p>I completed this intensive 12 week software development course so I could take my passion for tech, and
                turn it into a career by learning and embedding a solid foundation of modern software development
                skills.</p>
                <p>The curriculum primarily centred around Javascript & React, and gave me the opportunity to work on a
                real-client project.
                In 5 weeks we built a “Shift Reporter” web application for managing a mining workforce and fleet of
                vehicles.</p>
              <p>I worked in a team of 8, using agile development and the Scrum framework, working in weekly
                sprints and pair-programming. I also had the opportunity to start the project as team-leader, setting up
                the first sprint, running daily stand-ups, communicating with the clients / product owner and presenting
                our progress at the end of the week.
