        <p>I have recently completed a 12-week intensive software development course at
          <strong><a href="http://www.nology.io" target="_blank">_nology.</a></strong>
          This course was primarily centred on JavaScript and React. It tackled both technical coding
          finesse and practical workplace skills such as testing, pair programming, user stories and backlog creation.
        </p>
        <p>
          I am now seeking opportunites for a <strong>junior software developer</strong> position.</p>
        <p>I'd describe myself as a <strong>full stack developer</strong>, I like being creative with visual design in
          UX/UI, but equally enjoy logic and problem solving.
          I enjoy writing clean, concise and modern code. I build mobile first, intuative and responsive web apps.</p>

              <p>I completed this intensive 12 week software development course so I could take my passion for tech, and
                turn it into a career by learning and embedding a solid foundation of modern software development
                skills.</p>
              <p>The curriculum primarily centred around Javascript & React, and gave me the opportunity to work on a
                real-client project.
                In 5 weeks we built a “Shift Reporter” web application for managing a mining workforce and fleet of
                vehicles.</p>
              <p>I worked in a team of 8, using agile development and the Scrum framework, working in weekly
                sprints and pair-programming. I also had the opportunity to start the project as team-leader, setting up
                the first sprint, running daily stand-ups, communicating with the clients / product owner and presenting
                our progress at the end of the week.

        <h2>about</h2>
        <p>I enjoy a challange and I always approach problem solving with logic. Throughout my career I have always found this to be one of my key strengths.</p>
        <p>I’m very competitive person, and hold myself to high standards, I always try to excel at the task at hand.
        <p>I’m an ambitious person and I’d like to progress my career to a senior level. In both my two major employers I’ve shown strong development and progression.</p>
        <p>My development into leadership has taught me a wide array of soft skills, and the effectiveness of a high performing team that supports and develops each other. I’m a team player that values the strengths of others and how to connect, calibrate and contribute together. Working in a democratic business, and as an elected representative I’ve also learnt the ability to use team opinion to shape and influence business decision making and unlock the empowerment of individuals.</p>
        family
        I am due to be married to my fiancé , Sally, in 2022. This was due to 2021 but we decided to push it back a year when Covid cast some uncertainty over our savings plan and how long the country will have restrictions imposed. But we are still very much looking forward to our special day and we both love to travel so probably the honeymoon even more! We have a son, Arthur William Truby, who is currently 18 months old. He is a large motivation in life for me, I want to have a career I can be proud of, and provide for my family. We enjoy going on days out and are national trust members, Arthur is just starting to get more confident with his walking & recently started going to Nursery too.
        We live in Tamworth in the midlands, and we have family in Bristol, Swansea and Yeovil, so we often get together in Bristol as it is the epicentre of us all.
        interests
        Ever since my first mechanical experiences working at Halfords, I always enjoyed working with my hands. I still keep up bicycle mechanics as a hobby, but more commonly use my hands with any DIY project I can get stuck into. Most recently I took on the challenge of refitting our bathroom. 
        I’ve always had an interest in tech. I bought my first Mac computer is 2005 and have been a Mac person ever since, this started my enjoyment with computer media and I did a bit of professional video editing in the past. I’ve taken apart and serviced many personal electronics in the past, and enjoy understanding how things are made.
        I also like video gaming, I'm a console gamer and have recently made the switch to next generation with the PS5. I’m a completionism and enjoy trophy hunting on single player RPG games, and play online mostly on Call of Duty zombies and battle royale.I also enjoy TV and Cinema, I’m a bit of a Star Wars nerd, but not quite to the cos play level!
